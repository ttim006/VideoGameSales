Once we load the dataset onto BugQuery Sandbox, we examine the schema and identify the columns and their content, we name the data set vg-sales, and the table vg_data and the entire project vis called vg_sales-393913

Next we check for duplicate values for Video Games by name
SELECT Name, COUNT(Name)
FROM `vgsales-393913.vg_sales.vg_data`
GROUP BY Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

The code above shows we have duplicate Game entries because of different platforms

Then we check for Duplicate entries of games AND their platforms
SELECT a.*
FROM vgsales-393913.vg_sales.vg_data a
    JOIN(SELECT Name, Platform, COUNT(*)
    FROM vgsales-393913.vg_sales.vg_data
    GROUP BY Name, Platform 
    HAVING COUNT (*)> 1) b 
ON a.Name = b.Name
AND a.Platform = b.Platform
ORDER BY a.Name

This shows us 4 duplicate entries and it seems they have varying sales numbers, however, as neither of these titles are console exclusives, we can avoid them altogether

Remove the DESC to find the first year, this data set ranges from 1980-2020
SELECT Name, Year_Of_Release
FROM `vgsales-393913.vg_sales.vg_data` 
WHERE Year_Of_Release != 'N/A'
ORDER BY Year_Of_Release DESC

For our Analysis, we will stick to the years 2010-2017 for consisteny of data entries
Now, we create a filtered table, of entries between 2010-2017 and only first party titles
